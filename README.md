# TOTKDowngrade-1.2.0-Save-version
Downgrade Game upate and Game save to play TOTK on 1.1.1

DISCLAIMER: This may or may not result to a ban so do this at your own risk. I haven't found a guide so I made an effort to make this. 

Needed:
1. JKSV backup of 1.1.2/1.2.0 save
2. TOTK cartridge (I used 2 of them)
3. TOTK 1.1.1 NSP 391MB file (I used "TLOZ-TOTK-(USA)-NSwTcH-NSP-Update111-Ziperto")
4. Save the nsp file in the nsp folder in root or wherever
5. CFW switch on 16.0.3
6. Optional: Clean unhacked switch

  A. Revert Save Game version (so that game will not force you to download update when used):
1. Using CFW switch start with a clean sysnand and then create a new emunand from it. You can restore your sysnand backup for clean install
2. Do not link to nintendo id yet
3. In Emunand while offline, insert TOTK cartridge and dont install update.
4. Restore the 1.2.0 back and play the game. yes 1.0.0 TOTK will load 1.2.0 save just fine. :)
5. When game save is Loaded, save the game. This will convert that save slot to version 1.0 save!
6. Do this with all the slot by teleporting to sky, overworld, underground alternately while letting it autosave and do a hard save. Do this couple of times to overwrite all save slots with auto save and hard saves using the 1.0 version of the game.
7. Use JKSV to backup this new save game using a different name. 

  B. Create your Sysnand 1.1.1 Game Version:
1. In your CFW switch, Boot CFW to sysnand offline
2. Disable Auto software udpate in System
3. Plug TOTK cartridge and dont update (if you removed it)
4. Use Goldleaf to update game using the 1.1.1 file
C. OPTIONAL: Update your Clean switch with 1.1.1 Game Version:
1. If you want to play TOTK in a different switch, Reset factory settings that device to wipe TOTK game updates. Don't sync it yet with your Account, just create a user. Keep offline.
2. BOOT CFW switch to Stock FW
3. Use match version feature to install the 1.1.1 update to your clean switch. While game is selected, press + and under Software Update, use Math Version with Local Users feature.
4. Tun off auto update

  D. Downgrade your 1.2.0 Game save to 1.1.1 Game Save Version:
1. Boot to Sysnand CFW
2. Use JKSV to restore your fresh 1.0 game save
3. Run the game again and load your 1.0 saves
4. THEN convert your game saves to 1.1.1 by performing steps 5-6 from Section A (could be optional)
5. Backup the 1.1.1 saves again using different name. Just in case you want to edit the saves. ;)
6. Done!

  C. Resume the game in Stock FW
1. Boot up in Stock FW
2. Link the user account to your Nintendo account if you want (You can get a ban if you have other pirated stuff on your CFW switch!)
3. Enjoy!

D. OPTIONAL: Sync to Cloud save and play on your Clean 2nd console
1. Boot your CFW switch to Stock FW
2. Link the user account to your Nintendo account (You can get a ban if you have other pirated stuff on your CFW switch!)
3. Upload your save to Cloud Backup (error may show up saying Server save does not match local save until unified...etc)
4. Ignore error and Upload your save and overwrite your online save
5. From your clean switch, link your existing user to Your nintendo account
6. Download that 1.1.1 Cloud save
